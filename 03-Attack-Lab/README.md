# Attack Lab

## Introduction
Students are given binaries called ctarget and rtarget that have a buffer overflow bug. 
We are going to alter the behavior of the given targets via five increasingly difficult
exploits. The three attacks on ctarget use code injection. The two attacks on rtarget use
return-oriented programming.

## Code Injection Attacks

The `ctarget` has a main routine directs to a `test` function of the following

### Level 1

### Level 2

### Level 3
