# Attack Lab

Students are given binaries called ctarget and rtarget that have a
buffer overflow bug.  We are asked to alter the behavior of their
targets via five increasingly difficult exploits. The three attacks on
ctarget use code injection. The two attacks on rtarget use
return-oriented programming.
