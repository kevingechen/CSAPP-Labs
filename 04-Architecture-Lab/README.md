# Architecture Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, we are going to learn about the design and implementation of a pipelined Y86-64 processor,
optimizing both it and a benchmark program to maximize performance. You are allowed to make any semantics
preserving transformation to the benchmark program, or to make enhancements to the pipelined processor,
or both. When you have completed the lab, you will have a keen appreciation for the interactions between
code and hardware that affect the performance of your programs.

The lab consists of three tasks, respectively:
+ `Task 1`: write some simple Y86-64 programs and become familiar with the Y86-64 tools.
+ `Task 2`: extend the SEQ simulator with a new instruction.
+ `Task 3`: optimize the Y86-64 benchmark program and the processor design.

## Task 1
In this task, we will work under directory `src/sim/misc`.
We are going to write three Y86-64 programs simulating the example functions in [examples.c](src/sim/misc/examples.c)


## Task 2

## Task 3
